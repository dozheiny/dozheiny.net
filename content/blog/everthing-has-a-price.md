Every goddamn thing you see in the world has a price; honestly, it’s sad, but it’s true.

Last month, I was talking with a friend about how much responsibility falls on the developer in Golang software development. He said, *Did you know everything has a price, right?*<br/>
That made me think: *He’s right. Every decision I make has a price.*<br/>

Every choice we make has a cost, even the little ones.<br/>
If I decide to use an external library instead of the standard library, it has a cost. If I change my cat’s meal plan, it has a cost. If I take a different route home, it has a cost.<br/>
It makes me anxious. Every morning, every day, every hour, I think to myself, Am I making the right choice? Did I choose the best option? How do I know I didn’t make the wrong decision? And so on…
I don’t have answers to these questions. I just hope I made the best choice available.<br/>

But the best part is, the past is the past. What I did and chose belong to the past now. Maybe I’m paying the price now, or I will in the future, but it’s a lesson. I think we should learn this lesson: *Yes, everything has a price. But have I learned from my past mistakes?*
