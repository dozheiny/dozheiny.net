I recently finished reading Grokking Functional Programming by [Michał Płachta](https://michalplachta.com/), and it was hands down the best technical book I've ever read!
This book helped me write better code and understand programming concepts better.
Płachta explains tricky ideas so well that learning functional programming became fun. The book doesn't just teach theory but also gives practical examples you can use right away.
What's incredible is how the book focuses on immutability, higher-order functions, and pure functions. These ideas make code solid and easy to maintain. The exercises in the book helped me a lot, too.
Studying this book changed how I solve problems. I now write cleaner, shorter, and more excellent code thanks to what I learned about functional programming.
Overall, Grokking Functional Programming by Michał Płachta is a game-changer. This book is a must-read to improve functional programming or be a better coder.
